The steps required for designing and simulating the charginf ckt in LTSpice:
1. Open LTSpice and create a new schematic.
2. Add a voltage source and set its value to 3V and its resistance to 0.1 ohms. This simulates a 3V power supply capable of delivering 10A.
3. Add a series resistor of 0.2 ohms and connect it in series with the voltage source. This resistor limits the charging current to 5A.
4. Add a switch in series with the resistor to turn on/off the charging current.5. 
5. Define the switch model with the command ".MODEL [model_name] SW(Ron=[resistance when closed] Roff=[resistance when open] Vt=[threshold voltage])". For example, ".MODEL switch1 SW(Ron=1m Roff=1G Vt=0.5)" defines an ideal switch with a 1mohm resistance when closed, a 1Gohm resistance when open, and a threshold voltage of 0.5V.
6. Set the initial voltage of the capacitor to 0V and its capacitance to 100F.
7. Connect the supercapacitor in parallel with the switch and the resistor.
8. Add a voltage-controlled switch in series with the resistor and the supercapacitor. This switch will switch the circuit from constant current charging to constant voltage charging when the voltage across the capacitor reaches 2.6V.
9. Define the voltage-controlled switch model with the command ".MODEL [model_name] VSW(Ron=[resistance when closed] Roff=[resistance when open] Vt=[threshold voltage])". For example, ".MODEL vswitch1 VSW(Ron=1m Roff=1G Vt=2.6)" defines a voltage-controlled switch with a 1mohm resistance when closed, a 1Gohm resistance when open, and a threshold voltage of 2.6V.
10. Set the simulation time to 1 second and the timestep to 1 microsecond as described in the previous answer.
11. Add voltage probes to measure the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the resistor.
12. Run the simulation and plot the waveforms of the capacitor voltage and the resistor current.

The steps required to run the Python script:
1. Save the schematic and close LTSpice.
2. Use the LTSpice command line interface to run the simulation from Python. You can do this by creating a subprocess using the "subprocess" module in Python and passing the appropriate command line arguments to LTSpice.
